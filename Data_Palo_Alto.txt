Dear Idan,

Sorry for taking so long to follow up on this, we really appreciate your initiative to distribute more types of data!

Our current research is evolving around modelling the external output of computers, right now predominantly network traffic, but potentially also system logs, on a semantic level for anomaly detection. Therefore, we are interested in traffic data that is complete in the sense that no events are dropped via sampling or aggregated together.

In regards to this, it would be very interesting to us to view your network traffic dataset in an unaggregated format, i.e. to see the plain flows. This does not have to be for all the traffic in the network, but maybe just for some selected machines. We are also highly interested in looking at packet headers (we do not need any payloads).

Similarly, we are interested in relating network traffic to different data sources, such as system logs. For that, the timestamps and IDs of these events should be coherent across the different data sources. Los Alamos National Laboratory has released a comparable dataset: https://csr.lanl.gov/data/cyber1/


Another interest of ours is the evolution of traffic from particular programs as they are updated etc, i.e. to compare traffic generated by program X of version 1.0 with the traffic generated by X of version 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, etc, in order to provide this as a calibration measure for anomaly detection methods. I am aware that this is a very specific and comparably hard problem, and we are currently working on generating this traffic for selected applications on our own, but maybe you have ideas or interest in this problem.
