Both network traffic as well as system logs are essential data sources for the development of modern machine-learning driven cyber-security systems. So far, these two categories of data have only been used independently of each other, partly because of lacking synchronised capture systems.



We are hoping to extend our current data generation framework to capture both isolated network traffic and system logs of a set of containerised applications to receive a unified stream of data. Furthermore, we aim at developing a
