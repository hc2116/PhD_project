# Project

- Investigate to introduce artificial delays in traffic generation, look at effect

- New data for paper

- Think about second order features compared to first order 	features: What characterises a flow

- Look at exemplary malware network data
	- Flame	

- look at shadowserver

- write down steps for experiment
  - which containers generate which traffic
  - internal validity
  - traffic similarities
  - traffic statistics that are automatically generated
  - traffic filter for unwanted packages
  - compare traffic with http protocol description etc.
  - investigate http testing tools (tools that test if traffic from website is fulfilling http requirements)

- Blind signal separation (wikipedia) (Cocktail party problem)
	- Another look at traffic desagragation, also look at the use of factorial HMMs (like Guilio said), Imperial Guys (Oliver P..., ... Helly)


# Done

- Look at Nialls presentation
	- Network data is difuse and diverse
		- Tame this diversity by discovering structural model of flows, understanding flows
		- Events are not equal, but different in nature, we have to understand this nature
	- Anomalous behaviour is usually not a single occurrence, but: 
		- a chain of events
		- at multiple timescales (per second, per minute, per hour, per day, per week, ..)
		- at multiple layers
		- spanning multiple connected devices
		- occurring as isolated anomalies, bursts of anomalous activity, or persistent changes affecting not only traffic volume, but also IP destinations, applications, protocols, etc.
