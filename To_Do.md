# Project

- write down current thoughts on approach to overall project
  - autoencoder purpose
  - event correlation
  - datasets 
  - what are actions (on application level)
  - what can be identified as actions
  - think about research proposal?
  
- write down steps for experiment
  - which containers generate which traffic
  - internal validity
  - traffic similarities
  - traffic statistics that are automatically generated
  - traffic filter for unwanted packages
  - compare traffic with http protocol description etc.
  - investigate http testing tools (tools that test if traffic from website is fulfilling http requirements)
  
- investigate current traffic generation (especially the cic data!!!)
  - investigat

- Validate that ping and other scenarios are similar at different workloads, different environments (machines) etc.

- Compile list of datasets
  - investigate datasets in introduction of CIC paper
	- Look for survey on datasets
	- look for survey for artifical data generation
	- look for survey on behavioural characterisations
	- look at shadowserver

- Write down a list of approaches to cluster flows, finger printing, behavioural flow characterisation
	- comments, what has not been told
	- Think about second order features compared to first order features: What characterises a flow
	- Compile a little report with the questions

- Blind signal separation (wikipedia) (Cocktail party problem)
	- Another look at traffic desagragation, also look at the use of factorial HMMs (like Guilio said), Imperial Guys (Oliver P..., ... Helly)

- Investigate blackboard transmission for next call

# Done
- Look at BT Invitation (done)
