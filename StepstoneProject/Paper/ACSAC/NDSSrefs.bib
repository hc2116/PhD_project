	abstract = {In network intrusion detection research, one popular strategy for finding attacks is monitoring a network's activity for anomalies: deviations from profiles of normality previously learned from benign traffic, typically identified using tools borrowed from the machine learning community. However, despite extensive academic research one finds a striking gap in terms of actual deployments of such systems: compared with other intrusion detection approaches, machine learning is rarely employed in operational "real world" settings. We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively. We support this claim by identifying challenges particular to network intrusion detection, and provide a set of guidelines meant to strengthen future research on anomaly detection.},

	annote = {[DA summary]: an influential paper pointing out challenges of machine learning for intrusion detection compared to other applications of ML.  I think this is useful to follow references and literature that cites this paper, as well as to consider how any new approaches may help address the problems raised.
Main problems discussed:
1. Outlier detction.  Standard ML for classification is better at identifying things which are similar to those that have been seen before.  Outlier detection relies on closed world assumption, but we never see all examples of normal behaviours.
2. High cost of errors. False positives are overly expensive (network traffic analysis, reverse engineering etc).  False negatives can be catastrophic.
3. Difficulty recommending actions.  Anomaly detection alone doesn't explain what the problem is or what should be done, but this is what's needed.
4. Normal traffic is very diverse/variable. Low-level properties of traffic (packet/flow or application level) are unpredictable.
5. Hard to evaluate. Lack of data, ought to tie to recommended actions (ultimate measure of effectiveness), adversarial nature of setting.  (They argue that adversarial setting may be less critical than imagined in practice because learning how an IDS system operates in a particular setting is expensive for the attacker).
