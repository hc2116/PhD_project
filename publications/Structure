1 Introduction
	1.1. General lack of data compared to other areas
	1.2 Existing datasets are rigid, contain only some attacks
	1.3 Are generated from a non-dynamic fixed laboratory setting
	1.3 In contrast to other areas such as digit recognition, network traffic evolves and older datasets can become obsolete
	1.4 Need to extend existing data
	1.5 Need to generate unlimited amounts of data for specific types
	1.5 Ground truth behind data
		1.5.1 Applications that look at fine-grained structures need ground truth for model development and assessment
			ability to distinguish between different types of small-scale structures
			Stepping-stone detection, protocol verification, traffic classification, exploit analysis

	1.6 Data fusion
		Ability to match program outputs with traffic structures 
	1.7 Rare event problem


Motivation/requirements for dataset
	1.0 Real fine-grained traffic structures 
	1.1 Complete control of execution and thus Ground truth through matching of traffic sample with execution protocol
	1.2 Reproducable, semi-deterministic
	1.3 Realistic, represents real network behaviour and variation/errors
	1.4 


2. Available datasets
	2.1 Available ground truth
	2.2 Traffic generators


3. Framework architecture
	3.1 Randomisation
	3.2 Network delays,....
	3.3 Dataset generation

4. Experiments
