	abstract = {In network intrusion detection research, one popular strategy for finding attacks is monitoring a network's activity for anomalies: deviations from profiles of normality previously learned from benign traffic, typically identified using tools borrowed from the machine learning community. However, despite extensive academic research one finds a striking gap in terms of actual deployments of such systems: compared with other intrusion detection approaches, machine learning is rarely employed in operational "real world" settings. We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively. We support this claim by identifying challenges particular to network intrusion detection, and provide a set of guidelines meant to strengthen future research on anomaly detection.},

	annote = {[DA summary]: an influential paper pointing out challenges of machine learning for intrusion detection compared to other applications of ML.  I think this is useful to follow references and literature that cites this paper, as well as to consider how any new approaches may help address the problems raised.
Main problems discussed:
1. Outlier detction.  Standard ML for classification is better at identifying things which are similar to those that have been seen before.  Outlier detection relies on closed world assumption, but we never see all examples of normal behaviours.
2. High cost of errors. False positives are overly expensive (network traffic analysis, reverse engineering etc).  False negatives can be catastrophic.
3. Difficulty recommending actions.  Anomaly detection alone doesn't explain what the problem is or what should be done, but this is what's needed.
4. Normal traffic is very diverse/variable. Low-level properties of traffic (packet/flow or application level) are unpredictable.
5. Hard to evaluate. Lack of data, ought to tie to recommended actions (ultimate measure of effectiveness), adversarial nature of setting.  (They argue that adversarial setting may be less critical than imagined in practice because learning how an IDS system operates in a particular setting is expensive for the attacker).

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {Mobile devices have become a significant part of people’s lives, leading to an increasing number of users involved with such technology. The rising number of users invites hackers to generate malicious applications. Besides, the security of sensitive data available on mobile devices is taken lightly. Relying on currently developed approaches is not sufficient, given that intelligent malware keeps modifying rapidly and as a result becomes more difficult to detect. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution to evaluating malware detection using the anomaly-based approach with machine learning classifiers. Among the various network traffic features, the four categories selected are basic information, content based, time based and connection based. The evaluation utilizes two datasets: public (i.e. MalGenome) and private (i.e. self-collected). Based on the evaluation results, both the Bayes network and random forest classifiers produced more accurate readings, with a 99.97 \% true-positive rate (TPR) as opposed to the multi-layer perceptron with only 93.03 \% on the MalGenome dataset. However, this experiment revealed that the k-nearest neighbor classifier efficiently detected the latest Android malware with an 84.57 \% true-positive rate higher than other classifiers.},

	abstract = {The results of botnet detection methods are usually presented without any comparison. Although it is generally accepted that more comparisons with third-party methods may help to improve the area, few papers could do it. Among the factors that prevent a comparison are the difficulties to share a dataset, the lack of a good dataset, the absence of a proper description of the methods and the lack of a comparison methodology. This paper compares the output of three different botnet detection methods by executing them over a new, real, labeled and large botnet dataset. This dataset includes botnet, normal and background traffic. The results of our two methods (BClus and CAMNEP) and BotHunter were compared using a methodology and a novel error metric designed for botnet detections methods. We conclude that comparing methods indeed helps to better estimate how good the methods are, to improve the algorithms, to build better datasets and to build a comparison methodology.},

There are several improvements of this algorithm (e.g. TTT) and implementation that can be used (e.g. learnlib). 
I am however not convinced if active learning is the best approach, as we are interesting in learning from logs/traffic, where we will not query the data as such (i.e. generate new traffic). We could obviously "simulate" this from the logs (i.e. if a word is in the log that means it is correct, and false otherwise) but seems like an overkill. Passive learning seems more suitable (and efficient?) }

We can also then include a notion of "time" as parameter (at least w.r.t "time" since last message)}

We present a system that aims to detect bots, independent of any prior information about the command and control channels or propagation vectors, and without requiring multiple infections for correlation. Our system relies on detection models that target the characteristic fact that every bot receives commands from the botmaster to which it responds in a specific way. These detection models are generated automatically from network traffic traces recorded from actual bot instances. We have implemented the proposed approach and demonstrate that it can extract effective detection models for a variety of different bot families. These models are precise in describing the activity of bots and raise very few false positives.",

abstract="Stealthy malware, such as botnets and spyware, are hard to detect because their activities are subtle and do not disrupt the network, in contrast to DoS attacks and aggressive worms. Stealthy malware, however, does communicate to exfiltrate data to the attacker, to receive the attacker's commands, or to carry out those commands. Moreover, since malware rarely infiltrates only a single host in a large enterprise, these communications should emerge from multiple hosts within coarse temporal proximity to one another. In this paper, we describe a system called T{\={a}}md (pronounced ``tamed'') with which an enterprise can identify candidate groups of infected computers within its network. T{\={a}}md accomplishes this by finding new communication ``aggregates'' involving multiple internal hosts, i.e., communication flows that share common characteristics. We describe characteristics for defining aggregates---including flows that communicate with the same external network, that share similar payload, and/or that involve internal hosts with similar software platforms---and justify their use in finding infected hosts. We also detail efficient algorithms employed by T{\={a}}md for identifying such aggregates, and demonstrate a particular configuration of T{\={a}}md that identifies new infections for multiple bot and spyware examples, within traces of traffic recorded at the edge of a university network. This is achieved even when the number of infected hosts comprise only about 0.0097{\%} of all internal hosts in the network.",

Traffic classification aims at identifying the traffic mixture in the network. Several different classification approaches can be found in the literature. However, the validation of these methods is weak and ad hoc, because neither a reliable and widely accepted validation technique nor reference packet traces with well-defined content are available. In this paper, a novel validation method is proposed for characterizing the accuracy and completeness of traffic classification algorithms. The main advantages of the new method are that it is based on realistic traffic mixtures, and it enables a highly automated and reliable validation of traffic classification. As a proof-of-concept, it is examined how a state-of-the-art traffic classification method performs for the most common application types.",

Relay-like behaviour refers to the rapid commencement of an out-going flow from a network device following the completion of an in-coming flow. This paper develops a computationally efficient and temporally adaptive methodology for detecting relay-like behaviour. The methodology is demonstrated on a real example of NETFLOW data. In addition to providing a detector, further uses of the methodology for combining anomalous events are discussed.},
