Evaluating network intrusion detection systems research efforts, KDD98, KDDCUP99 and NSLKDD benchmark data sets were generated a decade ago. However, numerous current studies showed that for the current network threat environment, these data sets do not inclusively reflect network traffic and modern low footprint attacks. Countering the unavailability of network benchmark data set challenges, this paper examines a UNSW-NB15 data set creation. This data set has a hybrid of the real modern normal and the contemporary synthesized attack activities of the network traffic. Existing and novel methods are utilised to generate the features of the UNSWNB15 data set. This data set is available for research purposes and can be accessed from the link.},

In recent years, network-wide anomaly detection based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has emerged as a powerful method for detecting a wide variety of anomalies. We show that tuning PCA to operate effectively in practice is difficult and requires more robust techniques than have been presented thus far. We analyze a week of network-wide traffic measurements from two IP backbones (Abilene and Geant) across three different traffic aggregations (ingress routers, OD flows, and input links), and conduct a detailed inspection of the feature time series for each suspected anomaly. Our study identifies and evaluates four main challenges of using PCA to detect traffic anomalies: (i) the false positive rate is very sensitive to small differences in the number of principal components in the normal subspace, (ii) the effectiveness of PCA is sensitive to the level of aggregation of the traffic measurements, (iii) a large anomaly may in advertently pollute the normal subspace, (iv) correctly identifying which flow triggered the anomaly detector is an inherently challenging problem.},

In this paper, we utilize features of network flows, characterized by their entropy, together with an extended version of the original Replicator Neural Network (RNN) and deep learning techniques to learn models of normality. This combination allows us to apply anomaly-based intrusion detection on arbitrarily large amounts of data and, consequently, large networks. Our approach is unsupervised and requires no labeled data. It also accurately detects network-wide anomalies without presuming that the training data is completely free of attacks. The evaluation of our intrusion detection method, on top of real network data, indicates that it can accurately detect resource exhaustion attacks and network profiling techniques of varying intensities. The developed method is efficient because a normality model can be learned by training an RNN within a few seconds only.},

Anomaly detection is one of intrusion detection system. Current anomaly detection is often associated with high false alarm with moderate accuracy and detection rates when it's unable to detect all types of attacks correctly. To overcome this problem, we propose an hybrid learning approach through combination of K-Means clustering and Naïve Bayes classification. The proposed approach will be cluster all data into the corresponding group before applying a classifier for classification purpose. An experiment is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using KDD Cup'99 dataset. Result show that the proposed approach performed better in term of accuracy, detection rate with reasonable false alarm rate.},

In this paper, we address these two issues of Accuracy and Efficiency using Conditional Random Fields and Layered Approach. We demonstrate that high attack detection accuracy can be achieved by using Conditional Random Fields and high efficiency by implementing the Layered Approach. Experimental results on the benchmark KDD '99 intrusion data set show that our proposed system based on Layered Conditional Random Fields outperforms other well-known methods such as the decision trees and the naive Bayes. The improvement in attack detection accuracy is very high, particularly, for the U2R attacks (34.8 percent improvement) and the R2L attacks (34.5 percent improvement). Statistical Tests also demonstrate higher confidence in detection accuracy for our method. Finally, we show that our system is robust and is able to handle noisy data without compromising performance.},

Our approach is to classify modern CPS Intrusion Detection System (IDS) techniques based on two design dimensions: detection technique and audit material. We summarize advantages and drawbacks of each dimension’s options. We also summarize the most and least studied CPS IDS techniques in the literature and provide insight on the effectiveness of IDS techniques as they apply to CPSs.

Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

However, despite extensive academic research one finds a striking gap in terms of actual deployments of such systems: compared with other intrusion detection approaches, machine learning is rarely employed in operational "real world" settings. We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively. We support this claim by identifying challenges particular to network intrusion detection, and provide a set of guidelines meant to strengthen future research on anomaly detection.},

I think this is useful to follow references and literature that cites this paper, as well as to consider how any new approaches may help address the problems raised. Main problems discussed: 1. Outlier detction.  Standard ML for classification is better at identifying things which are similar to those that have been seen before.  Outlier detection relies on closed world assumption, but we never see all examples of normal behaviours. 2. High cost of errors. False positives are overly expensive (network traffic analysis, reverse engineering etc).  False negatives can be catastrophic. 3. Difficulty recommending actions.  Anomaly detection alone doesn't explain what the problem is or what should be done, but this is what's needed. 4. Normal traffic is very diverse/variable. Low-level properties of traffic (packet/flow or application level) are unpredictable. 5. Hard to evaluate. Lack of data, ought to tie to recommended actions (ultimate measure of effectiveness), adversarial nature of setting.  (They argue that adversarial setting may be less critical than imagined in practice because learning how an IDS system operates in a particular setting is expensive for the attacker).},

This holds true, as more and more organisations admit compromises on a daily basis. Many misuse and anomaly based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that rely on either signatures, supervised or statistical methods have been proposed in the literature, but their trustworthiness is debatable. Moreover, as this work uncovers, the current IDSs are based on obsolete attack classes that do not reflect the current attack trends. For these reasons, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of unsupervised and hybrid methods for intrusion detection, discussing their potential in the domain. We also present and highlight the importance of feature engineering techniques that have been proposed for intrusion detection. Furthermore, we discuss that current IDSs should evolve from simple detection to correlation and attribution. We descant how IDS data could be used to reconstruct and correlate attacks to identify attackers, with the use of advanced data analytics techniques. Finally, we argue how the present IDS attack classes can be extended to match the modern attacks and propose three new classes regarding the outgoing network communication.},

These are networks that do not have an underlying infrastructure; the network topology is constantly changing. The inherently vulnerable characteristics of wireless ad hoc networks make them susceptible to attacks, and it may be too late before any counter action can take effect. Second, with so much advancement in hacking, if attackers try hard enough they will eventually succeed in infiltrating the system. This makes it important to constantly (or at least periodically) monitor what is taking place on a system and look for suspicious behavior. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do just that: monitor audit data, look for intrusions to the system, and initiate a proper response (e.g., email the systems administrator, start an automatic retaliation). As such, there is a need to complement traditional security mechanisms with efficient intrusion detection and response. In this article we present a survey on the work that has been done in the area of intrusion detection in mobile ad hoc networks.},

It is the prevalence of such threats that has made intrusion detection systems—the cyberspace’s equivalent to the burglar alarm—join ranks with firewalls as one of the fundamental technologies for network security. However, today’s commercially available intrusion detection systems are predominantly signature-based intrusion detection systems that are designed to detect known attacks by utilizing the signatures of those attacks. Such systems require frequent rule-base updates and signature updates, and are not capable of detecting unknown attacks. In contrast, anomaly detection systems, a subset of intrusion detection systems, model the normal system/network behavior which enables them to be extremely effective in finding and foiling both known as well as unknown or “zero day” attacks. While anomaly detection systems are attractive conceptually, a host of technological problems need to be overcome before they can be widely adopted. These problems include: high false alarm rate, failure to scale to gigabit speeds, etc. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of anomaly detection systems and hybrid intrusion detection systems of the recent past and present.

They observe the actions of the system and its users and make decisions about the legitimacy of the activity and users. Much work on intrusion detection has focused on analysing the actions triggered by users, determining that atypical or disallowed actions may represent unauthorised use. It is also feasible to observe the users' own behaviour to see if they are acting in their'usual' way, reporting on any sufficiently-aberrant behaviour. Doing this requires a user profile, a feature found more often in marketing and education, but increasingly in security contexts. In this paper, we survey literature on intrusion detection and prevention systems from the viewpoint of exploiting the behaviour of the user in the context of their user profile to confirm or deny the legitimacy of their presence on the system (i.e. review of intrusion detection and prevention systems aimed at user profiling). User behaviour can be measured with both behavioural biometrics, such as keystroke speeds or mouse use, but also psychometrics which measure higher-order cognitive functions such as language and preferences.},

The rising number of users invites hackers to generate malicious applications. Besides, the security of sensitive data available on mobile devices is taken lightly. Relying on currently developed approaches is not sufficient, given that intelligent malware keeps modifying rapidly and as a result becomes more difficult to detect. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution to evaluating malware detection using the anomaly-based approach with machine learning classifiers. Among the various network traffic features, the four categories selected are basic information, content based, time based and connection based. The evaluation utilizes two datasets: public (i.e. MalGenome) and private (i.e. self-collected). Based on the evaluation results, both the Bayes network and random forest classifiers produced more accurate readings, with a 99.97 \% true-positive rate (TPR) as opposed to the multi-layer perceptron with only 93.03 \% on the MalGenome dataset. However, this experiment revealed that the k-nearest neighbor classifier efficiently detected the latest Android malware with an 84.57 \% true-positive rate higher than other classifiers.},

Although it is generally accepted that more comparisons with third-party methods may help to improve the area, few papers could do it. Among the factors that prevent a comparison are the difficulties to share a dataset, the lack of a good dataset, the absence of a proper description of the methods and the lack of a comparison methodology. This paper compares the output of three different botnet detection methods by executing them over a new, real, labeled and large botnet dataset. This dataset includes botnet, normal and background traffic. The results of our two methods (BClus and CAMNEP) and BotHunter were compared using a methodology and a novel error metric designed for botnet detections methods. We conclude that comparing methods indeed helps to better estimate how good the methods are, to improve the algorithms, to build better datasets and to build a comparison methodology.},

This relies on a teaching you can ask (1) membership queries (i.e. is this sequence/word valid) and (2) equivalence queries (i.e. is this automata correct - and give a counter-example if not). There are several improvements of this algorithm (e.g. TTT) and implementation that can be used (e.g. learnlib). I am however not convinced if active learning is the best approach, as we are interesting in learning from logs/traffic, where we will not query the data as such (i.e. generate new traffic). We could obviously "simulate" this from the logs (i.e. if a word is in the log that means it is correct, and false otherwise) but seems like an overkill. Passive learning seems more suitable (and efficient?)}

		From Software Engineering rather than security domain. Learns automata from logs on concurrent behaviour (i.e. from different communication machines). Uses an interesting approach from learning from logs only (i.e. no negative examples)

		First temporal invariants are mined from the logs Then a concrete FSM are generated ... and (over-)abstracted into an abstract FSM The temporal invariants are then used to refine the abstract FSM so all invariants are satisfied. The refinement is guided by counter-examples  (seems similar to CEGAR but not sure how it relates)

	abstract     = {A botnet is a network of compromised hosts that is under the control of a single, malicious entity, often called the botmaster. We present a system that aims to detect bots, independent of any prior information about the command and control channels or propagation vectors, and without requiring multiple infections for correlation. Our system relies on detection models that target the characteristic fact that every bot receives commands from the botmaster to which it responds in a specific way. These detection models are generated automatically from network traffic traces recorded from actual bot instances. We have implemented the proposed approach and demonstrate that it can extract effective detection models for a variety of different bot families. These models are precise in describing the activity of bots and raise very few false positives.}

	abstract     = {Stealthy malware, such as botnets and spyware, are hard to detect because their activities are subtle and do not disrupt the network, in contrast to DoS attacks and aggressive worms. Stealthy malware, however, does communicate to exfiltrate data to the attacker, to receive the attacker's commands, or to carry out those commands. Moreover, since malware rarely infiltrates only a single host in a large enterprise, these communications should emerge from multiple hosts within coarse temporal proximity to one another. In this paper, we describe a system called T{\={a}}md (pronounced ``tamed'') with which an enterprise can identify candidate groups of infected computers within its network. T{\={a}}md accomplishes this by finding new communication ``aggregates'' involving multiple internal hosts, i.e., communication flows that share common characteristics. We describe characteristics for defining aggregates---including flows that communicate with the same external network, that share similar payload, and/or that involve internal hosts with similar software platforms---and justify their use in finding infected hosts. We also detail efficient algorithms employed by T{\={a}}md for identifying such aggregates, and demonstrate a particular configuration of T{\={a}}md that identifies new infections for multiple bot and spyware examples, within traces of traffic recorded at the edge of a university network. This is achieved even when the number of infected hosts comprise only about 0.0097{\%} of all internal hosts in the network.}
