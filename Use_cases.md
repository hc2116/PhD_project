### Project thoughts:

- Project start: September, possibly for three months, depending how much time is needed to achieve goals
- Project will be about generation of realistic traffic with attacks
	- We both need data that contains benign traffic as well as attack traffic that we want to examine
	- I could apply packet-sequence modelling developed during the summer
	- Docker framework could be used as starting point, although we want to

- Interesing use-cases they presented:
	- Stepping-stone detection
	- Unusual User Agents
	- Maybe session-hijacking, etc. (man-in-the-middle attacks)
- These all need appropriate datasets that contain enough benign traffic to train a model

- BT might have people with knowledge about attack traffic, networking, etc. and resources to help?
- It is easier to benefit from people at BT than developing technical model where the detailed knowledge might not be there

- If that is objected, I would suggest working on traffic disaggregation

- Additional things: 
	- Do I have to get involved with Robs project? Should be starting soon right?
	- NVIDIA statement (how much time to put into it? How likely we get it? Wait till paper is submitted?)

###David's comments:
- Drill down on the difference between acamedic environment and real-world
- Good position on publications as we have industrial validation for the relevance for industry
- Suggest discussion on the industry situation on the data that they are collecting,
- think about the future/change in network infrastructure
	- is the home-application interesting
	- devices going to the edge (5G computing pushed to periphery)
- Present results from paper
- Fadi El-Mousse at BT
- Shadowserver people
- Dell Secureworks
- Agenda-item: Find out what they are working on
- Pitch idea of conversation fingerprinting
- Maybe have a little presentation in front of interested people


### Who is working on what

Michael, Giulio, Lea: Working on word-to-vec and anomaly detection, figuring out how general methods are (i.e. if they work on all plattforms, traffic,....)
Alex: Supposedly works a lot on stepping-stones recently, also visuals 
Lea: Embeddings, word-to-vec
Graham: Leading the "V.." visualisation project

Alfie: SOOR, reaction at the detection of an intrusion
Alex: Stepping stone detection, is looking for data

Guy opposite of Alfie: Is looking at collaboration and sharing of data, how to enable the sharing of data and how to run analytics on it, working on the plattform they are developing (ask for name?), sounds a bit similar to Galois

Sadiq: Active learning, labelling problem, how can supervised learning help unsupervised learning, only been there for a month




##### Michael lunch

Not to worry too much about encryption and IPv6, IPv6 will probably not be used in consumer market too soon, also not that much in enterprise settings
Encryption is not perfect, you still have to exchange keys


##### Presentation comments and discussion afterwards

Alex comments: Is similar to Word-to-Vec what Michael, Giulio, and Lea are doing. This is essentially projecting flows to a vector based on similarity of discrete objects such as IP address, Port, etc., like words in a sentence are projected to a vector based on their similarity (cat,dog for example)

Consideration for project: Apply my model to a very specific use-case of a specific type of attack that is also interesting for BT. I could benefit from the knowledge of the Security-team (which is responsible for disecting malware and giving direction on urgent security problems).

A specific idea of Michael is to apply this to stepping stones. Here, stepping stones are kind of similar to Replay-attacks, where a specific sets of packets are sniffed from A and B to potentially have passwords etc. captured, and are then reproduced in another connection to get access? Can the model detect that this is done in another connection? Is this realistic. 

Stepping stones where also described by Michael as an evolution, where information is passed from A to B to C, but with different protocols to cloud their activity.

We have to discuss more with Alex


#### Meeting with Alex H, Alex T, Michael, Giulio

Stepping stone as a general proxy that is used in a malicious way, that replicates information 
Alex T could get data on stepping stones from some backbone
Otherwise fabricate data with Docker? SSH tunnel containers exist
Use my model to identify what is going on in a connection
Alex T says that my research could definitely be used in stepping stone detection
They really like the virtual environment to generate data
Pcaps can be retreived at BT, but only temporarily

R2L and U2R attacks are too low-level for the BT team, too much like malware disection
some other people at BT might be doing this


from 19th August would work well

My thought: addind stepping stone to docker framework would help the publications of the framework

### Use-Cases






Hi All, 
 
Good to meet up the other week. David, you asked about a project that Henry could get his teeth into for a few months. I thought that in advance of our catch up call this afternoon Iâ€™d send across some of the most pertinent security threat detection use cases that we are always interested in finding new techniques for. Failing being able to anonymise and distribute some BT production data for you to work with (it is looking like it will take significant time to get this far), my suggestion would be to look at which one (or many) of these use cases looks easiest to develop against using public domain or otherwise synthetic datasets. Your thoughts on any of these most welcome. We may have to do a bit of digging ourselves before answering in-depth questions though. 
 
Regards,
Alex 
 
 
#### Stepping-stone detection
Aim to implement an algorithm to detect use of potentially malicious stepping stones within the corporate network with a manageable proportion of false positives.
Some example papers on the concept are: 
http://cs.unc.edu/~fabian/course_papers/Stepping-Stones.pdf
https://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-540-30143-1_14.pdf
Use of multiple taps within an enterprise network. 
Several feed types/protocols may be used, e.g. NetFlow, SSH, RDP.
 

#### C2 & Malware Beaconing Detection
Detect unusual changes in network behaviour (e.g. DNS lookups) which might enable detection of C2 infrastructure.
Data exfiltration in DNS may be another indicator, e.g. high numbers of unique non-textual hostname part in requests (there may or may not be a response - currently we only have response logs; we have a backlog item to add DNS request logs).
Regular DNS requests (or responses) between a host and a domain may carry C2 traffic. The regularity may be approximate because of jitter deliberately added by the malware, as well as because of hosts being shut-down or disconnected. There may be some non-regular traffic in between, e.g. to respond to an initial command. The periodic unit may be a set of requests, i.e. a group of requests that are not periodic in themselves may be repeated regularly as a group. Domain names themselves might be cycled, i.e. successive requests at regular intervals made to each domain name in a series of domain names.
 

#### Behavioural change detection
Detect significant, but not previously characterised, changes in the pattern of activity of devices in an enterprise network that indicate potentially malicious activity with high confidence. Detection of deviation from an established, consistent pattern of behaviour for a host (or user or application). May not be effective on devices with highly variable normal behaviour. May not be sufficiently indicative on its own, but may contribute to scoring other alerts for the host. Could apply to almost any protocol.

 
#### Port Scanning
Detection of port scanning. May be single host multiple ports, or single port multiple hosts, or a combination. 
May be increased attention to a new port for scanning. May be at a low rate to avoid normal detection.
Location of probes on the exit from a datacentre may limit our ability to detect scanning.
Port scanning probably occurs quite extensively from normal network management. How can this be eliminated?
 
 
#### Unusual User Agents
Identify user agents that are untypical or new for a user and are not common across an enterprise network.
