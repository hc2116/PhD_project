Intrusion response system



Risk management



Alert correlation


A comprehensive approach for networkattack forecasting


We define an uncertainty-aware attack graph to evaluatethe network security state by considering the uncertaintyof attack probabilities.
We analyze the IDS alerts and intrusion responses to iden-tify nodes that may be at risk in the future and update theuncertainty-aware attack graph based on this information.â€¢ We define a forecasting attack graph using the uncertainty-aware attack graph and dependency graph information toestimate the risk of future attacks. This forecasting attackgraph provides a high-level insight into the security stateof the network under surveillance
