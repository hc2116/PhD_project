Research Topic:
	- Research Topic: What is the problem? Why is it interesting? What has already been done by other people to address it? Why are these existing approaches / solutions inadequate?  
	
	- Your Approach: What new approach / angle / idea are you proposing to pursue? Why does it seem promising?
	
	- Your Plan: What are the sub-goals that need to be achieved? What is your planned order of attack, and how long do you expect each task to take? Does the schedule make it plausible that you will achieve the required work within the prescribed period of the PhD programme?  And what are the risks in this plan and how will you address them (contingency plans)?
