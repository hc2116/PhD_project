Evaluating network intrusion detection systems research efforts, KDD98, KDDCUP99 and NSLKDD benchmark data sets were generated a decade ago. However, numerous current studies showed that for the current network threat environment, these data sets do not inclusively reflect network traffic and modern low footprint attacks. Countering the unavailability of network benchmark data set challenges, this paper examines a UNSW-NB15 data set creation. This data set has a hybrid of the real modern normal and the contemporary synthesized attack activities of the network traffic. Existing and novel methods are utilised to generate the features of the UNSWNB15 data set. This data set is available for research purposes and can be accessed from the link.},

In recent years, network-wide anomaly detection based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has emerged as a powerful method for detecting a wide variety of anomalies. We show that tuning PCA to operate effectively in practice is difficult and requires more robust techniques than have been presented thus far. We analyze a week of network-wide traffic measurements from two IP backbones (Abilene and Geant) across three different traffic aggregations (ingress routers, OD flows, and input links), and conduct a detailed inspection of the feature time series for each suspected anomaly. Our study identifies and evaluates four main challenges of using PCA to detect traffic anomalies: (i) the false positive rate is very sensitive to small differences in the number of principal components in the normal subspace, (ii) the effectiveness of PCA is sensitive to the level of aggregation of the traffic measurements, (iii) a large anomaly may in advertently pollute the normal subspace, (iv) correctly identifying which flow triggered the anomaly detector is an inherently challenging problem.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of finding outliers in large multivariate databases. Outlier detection can be applied during the data cleansing process of data mining to identify problems with the data itself, and to fraud detection where groups of outliers are often of particular interest. We use replicator neural networks (RNNs) to provide a measure of the outlyingness of data records. The performance of the RNNs is assessed using a ranked score measure. The effectiveness of the RNNs for outlier detection is demonstrated on two publicly available databases.},

	doi = {10.1109/PST.2016.7906980},
	abstract = {Defending key network infrastructure, such as Internet backbone links or the communication channels of critical infrastructure, is paramount, yet challenging. The inherently complex nature and quantity of network data impedes detecting attacks in real world settings. In this paper, we utilize features of network flows, characterized by their entropy, together with an extended version of the original Replicator Neural Network (RNN) and deep learning techniques to learn models of normality. This combination allows us to apply anomaly-based intrusion detection on arbitrarily large amounts of data and, consequently, large networks. Our approach is unsupervised and requires no labeled data. It also accurately detects network-wide anomalies without presuming that the training data is completely free of attacks. The evaluation of our intrusion detection method, on top of real network data, indicates that it can accurately detect resource exhaustion attacks and network profiling techniques of varying intensities. The developed method is efficient because a normality model can be learned by training an RNN within a few seconds only.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on an important research problem of Big Data classification in intrusion detection system. Deep Belief Networks is introduced to the field of intrusion detection, and an intrusion detection model based on Deep Belief Networks is proposed to apply in intrusion recognition domain. The deep hierarchical model is a deep neural network classifier of a combination of multilayer unsupervised learning networks, which is called as Restricted Boltzmann Machine, and a supervised learning network, which is called as Back-propagation network. The experimental results on KDD CUP 1999 dataset demonstrate that the performance of Deep Belief Networks model is better than that of SVM and ANN.},
