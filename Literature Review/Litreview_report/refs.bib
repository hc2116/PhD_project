Evaluating network intrusion detection systems research efforts, KDD98, KDDCUP99 and NSLKDD benchmark data sets were generated a decade ago. However, numerous current studies showed that for the current network threat environment, these data sets do not inclusively reflect network traffic and modern low footprint attacks. Countering the unavailability of network benchmark data set challenges, this paper examines a UNSW-NB15 data set creation. This data set has a hybrid of the real modern normal and the contemporary synthesized attack activities of the network traffic. Existing and novel methods are utilised to generate the features of the UNSWNB15 data set. This data set is available for research purposes and can be accessed from the link.},

In recent years, network-wide anomaly detection based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has emerged as a powerful method for detecting a wide variety of anomalies. We show that tuning PCA to operate effectively in practice is difficult and requires more robust techniques than have been presented thus far. We analyze a week of network-wide traffic measurements from two IP backbones (Abilene and Geant) across three different traffic aggregations (ingress routers, OD flows, and input links), and conduct a detailed inspection of the feature time series for each suspected anomaly. Our study identifies and evaluates four main challenges of using PCA to detect traffic anomalies: (i) the false positive rate is very sensitive to small differences in the number of principal components in the normal subspace, (ii) the effectiveness of PCA is sensitive to the level of aggregation of the traffic measurements, (iii) a large anomaly may in advertently pollute the normal subspace, (iv) correctly identifying which flow triggered the anomaly detector is an inherently challenging problem.},

Outlier detection can be applied during the data cleansing process of data mining to identify problems with the data itself, and to fraud detection where groups of outliers are often of particular interest. We use replicator neural networks (RNNs) to provide a measure of the outlyingness of data records. The performance of the RNNs is assessed using a ranked score measure. The effectiveness of the RNNs for outlier detection is demonstrated on two publicly available databases.},

	abstract = {Defending key network infrastructure, such as Internet backbone links or the communication channels of critical infrastructure, is paramount, yet challenging. The inherently complex nature and quantity of network data impedes detecting attacks in real world settings. In this paper, we utilize features of network flows, characterized by their entropy, together with an extended version of the original Replicator Neural Network (RNN) and deep learning techniques to learn models of normality. This combination allows us to apply anomaly-based intrusion detection on arbitrarily large amounts of data and, consequently, large networks. Our approach is unsupervised and requires no labeled data. It also accurately detects network-wide anomalies without presuming that the training data is completely free of attacks. The evaluation of our intrusion detection method, on top of real network data, indicates that it can accurately detect resource exhaustion attacks and network profiling techniques of varying intensities. The developed method is efficient because a normality model can be learned by training an RNN within a few seconds only.},

Malicious data in a SCADA system disrupt its correct functioning and tamper with its normal operation. OCSVM (One-Class Support Vector Machine) is an intrusion detection mechanism that does not need any labeled data for training or any information about the kind of anomaly is expecting for the detection process. This feature makes it ideal for processing SCADA environment data and automate SCADA performance monitoring. The OCSVM module developed is trained by network traces off line and detect anomalies in the system real time. The module is part of an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) system developed under CockpitCI project and communicates with the other parts of the system by the exchange of IDMEF (Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format) messages that carry information about the source of the incident, the time and a classification of the alarm.},

Current anomaly detection is often associated with high false alarm with moderate accuracy and detection rates when it's unable to detect all types of attacks correctly. To overcome this problem, we propose an hybrid learning approach through combination of K-Means clustering and Naïve Bayes classification. The proposed approach will be cluster all data into the corresponding group before applying a classifier for classification purpose. An experiment is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using KDD Cup'99 dataset.

In this paper, we address these two issues of Accuracy and Efficiency using Conditional Random Fields and Layered Approach. We demonstrate that high attack detection accuracy can be achieved by using Conditional Random Fields and high efficiency by implementing the Layered Approach. Experimental results on the benchmark KDD '99 intrusion data set show that our proposed system based on Layered Conditional Random Fields outperforms other well-known methods such as the decision trees and the naive Bayes. The improvement in attack detection accuracy is very high, particularly, for the U2R attacks (34.8 percent improvement) and the R2L attacks (34.5 percent improvement). Statistical Tests also demonstrate higher confidence in detection accuracy for our method. Finally, we show that our system is robust and is able to handle noisy data without compromising performance.},

In order to identify gaps and propose research directions in CPS intrusion detection research, we survey the literature of this area. Our approach is to classify modern CPS Intrusion Detection System (IDS) techniques based on two design dimensions: detection technique and audit material. We summarize advantages and drawbacks of each dimension’s options. We also summarize the most and least studied CPS IDS techniques in the literature and provide insight on the effectiveness of IDS techniques as they apply to CPSs. Finally, we identify gaps in CPS IDS research and suggest future research areas.},

Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

	abstract = {In network intrusion detection research, one popular strategy for finding attacks is monitoring a network's activity for anomalies: deviations from profiles of normality previously learned from benign traffic, typically identified using tools borrowed from the machine learning community. However, despite extensive academic research one finds a striking gap in terms of actual deployments of such systems: compared with other intrusion detection approaches, machine learning is rarely employed in operational "real world" settings. We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively. We support this claim by identifying challenges particular to network intrusion detection, and provide a set of guidelines meant to strengthen future research on anomaly detection.},

	annote = {[DA summary]: an influential paper pointing out challenges of machine learning for intrusion detection compared to other applications of ML.  I think this is useful to follow references and literature that cites this paper, as well as to consider how any new approaches may help address the problems raised.
Main problems discussed:
1. Outlier detction.  Standard ML for classification is better at identifying things which are similar to those that have been seen before.  Outlier detection relies on closed world assumption, but we never see all examples of normal behaviours.
2. High cost of errors. False positives are overly expensive (network traffic analysis, reverse engineering etc).  False negatives can be catastrophic.
3. Difficulty recommending actions.  Anomaly detection alone doesn't explain what the problem is or what should be done, but this is what's needed.
4. Normal traffic is very diverse/variable. Low-level properties of traffic (packet/flow or application level) are unpredictable.
5. Hard to evaluate. Lack of data, ought to tie to recommended actions (ultimate measure of effectiveness), adversarial nature of setting.  (They argue that adversarial setting may be less critical than imagined in practice because learning how an IDS system operates in a particular setting is expensive for the attacker).

Many misuse and anomaly based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that rely on either signatures, supervised or statistical methods have been proposed in the literature, but their trustworthiness is debatable. Moreover, as this work uncovers, the current IDSs are based on obsolete attack classes that do not reflect the current attack trends. For these reasons, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of unsupervised and hybrid methods for intrusion detection, discussing their potential in the domain. We also present and highlight the importance of feature engineering techniques that have been proposed for intrusion detection. Furthermore, we discuss that current IDSs should evolve from simple detection to correlation and attribution. We descant how IDS data could be used to reconstruct and correlate attacks to identify attackers, with the use of advanced data analytics techniques. Finally, we argue how the present IDS attack classes can be extended to match the modern attacks and propose three new classes regarding the outgoing network communication.},

	abstract = {Intrusion detection has, over the last few years, assumed paramount importance within the broad realm of network security, more so in the case of wireless ad hoc networks. These are networks that do not have an underlying infrastructure; the network topology is constantly changing. The inherently vulnerable characteristics of wireless ad hoc networks make them susceptible to attacks, and it may be too late before any counter action can take effect. Second, with so much advancement in hacking, if attackers try hard enough they will eventually succeed in infiltrating the system. This makes it important to constantly (or at least periodically) monitor what is taking place on a system and look for suspicious behavior. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do just that: monitor audit data, look for intrusions to the system, and initiate a proper response (e.g., email the systems administrator, start an automatic retaliation). As such, there is a need to complement traditional security mechanisms with efficient intrusion detection and response. In this article we present a survey on the work that has been done in the area of intrusion detection in mobile ad hoc networks.},

Nevertheless, the benefits which could be obtained from a better understanding of the problem itself as well as the improvement of these mechanisms, especially in network security, justify the demand for more research efforts in this direction. This article presents a survey on current anomaly detection methods for network intrusion detection in classical wired environments. After introducing the problem and elucidating its interest, a taxonomy of current solutions is presented. The outlined scheme allows us to systematically classify current detection methods as well as to study the different facets of the problem. The more relevant paradigms are subsequently discussed and illustrated through several case studies of selected systems developed in the field. The problems addressed by each of them as well as their weakest points are thus explained. Finally, this work concludes with an analysis of the problems that still remain open.

	abstract = {This survey paper describes a focused literature survey of machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) methods for cyber analytics in support of intrusion detection. Short tutorial descriptions of each ML/DM method are provided. Based on the number of citations or the relevance of an emerging method, papers representing each method were identified, read, and summarized. Because data are so important in ML/DM approaches, some well-known cyber data sets used in ML/DM are described. The complexity of ML/DM algorithms is addressed, discussion of challenges for using ML/DM for cyber security is presented, and some recommendations on when to use a given method are provided.},

	abstract = {As advances in networking technology help to connect the distant corners of the globe and as the Internet continues to expand its influence as a medium for communications and commerce, the threat from spammers, attackers and criminal enterprises has also grown accordingly. It is the prevalence of such threats that has made intrusion detection systems—the cyberspace’s equivalent to the burglar alarm—join ranks with firewalls as one of the fundamental technologies for network security. However, today’s commercially available intrusion detection systems are predominantly signature-based intrusion detection systems that are designed to detect known attacks by utilizing the signatures of those attacks. Such systems require frequent rule-base updates and signature updates, and are not capable of detecting unknown attacks. In contrast, anomaly detection systems, a subset of intrusion detection systems, model the normal system/network behavior which enables them to be extremely effective in finding and foiling both known as well as unknown or “zero day” attacks. While anomaly detection systems are attractive conceptually, a host of technological problems need to be overcome before they can be widely adopted. These problems include: high false alarm rate, failure to scale to gigabit speeds, etc. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of anomaly detection systems and hybrid intrusion detection systems of the recent past and present. We also discuss recent technological trends in anomaly detection and identify open problems and challenges in this area.},

	abstract = {Intrusion detection systems are important for detecting and reacting to the presence of unauthorised users of a network or system. They observe the actions of the system and its users and make decisions about the legitimacy of the activity and users. Much work on intrusion detection has focused on analysing the actions triggered by users, determining that atypical or disallowed actions may represent unauthorised use. It is also feasible to observe the users' own behaviour to see if they are acting in their'usual' way, reporting on any sufficiently-aberrant behaviour. Doing this requires a user profile, a feature found more often in marketing and education, but increasingly in security contexts. In this paper, we survey literature on intrusion detection and prevention systems from the viewpoint of exploiting the behaviour of the user in the context of their user profile to confirm or deny the legitimacy of their presence on the system (i.e. review of intrusion detection and prevention systems aimed at user profiling). User behaviour can be measured with both behavioural biometrics, such as keystroke speeds or mouse use, but also psychometrics which measure higher-order cognitive functions such as language and preferences.},
